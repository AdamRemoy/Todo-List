# ðŸ”— Todo List

The main goal of this project is to get comfortable with **SwiftData** to achieve **persistent, locally stored data** on the device. The app is built with **SwiftUI** and uses components like `NavigationStack`, `List`, and multiple views to create a clean and functional task manager. Tasks are modeled using the `@Model` macro and shared across views using SwiftDataâ€™s environment system.
